## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start Redis (if you don't have it)
make up

# Find duplicates and get a report
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path /path/to/your/mess

# Done. Check duplicate_report.md for the goods.
```

Example:
```markdown
### Group 1 (3 files, 2.1 MB each)

**Hash:** `d2a84f4b8b650937ec8f73cd8be2c74add5a911ba64df27458ed8229da804a26`

**Files:**
1. 👑 **Original** (oldest) `photos/vacation.jpg` (2023-10-01 12:00:00)
2. 🔄 **Duplicate** `backup/vacation_copy.jpg` (2023-10-02 15:30:00)
3. 🔄 **Duplicate** `temp/vacation_temp.jpg` (2023-10-03 09:15:00)
```

## Commands That Matter

```bash
# The main event (auto-detects optimal workers)
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path /your/files

# Control parallel workers (more = faster, but uses more resources)
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path /your/files --workers 8

# Skip the report (why would you?)
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path /your/files --no-report

# Custom report name (overrides auto-naming)
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path /your/files --report-output my_cleanup.md

# Quick stats
uv run dedupe stats

# Clean slate
uv run dedupe clean
```

## Makefile Shortcuts

```bash
make up          # Start Redis
make down        # Stop Redis
make dedupe      # Dedupe current directory
make report      # Generate report manually
make clean-all   # Nuclear option - clean everything
```

## Test It Out

Want to see it in action? Generate some test data:

```bash
# Create 1000 dummy images with 30% duplicates
make create-images

# Dedupe them
uv run dedupe deduplicate --scan-path dummy_images

# Marvel at your report
cat duplicate_report.md
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Redis (we'll start it for you)
- Some files to dedupe (obviously)

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

Super Deduper uses a hybrid storage approach with parallel processing to achieve high performance and reliability:

```

### Core Components

#### 1. **Parallel File Processing**
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** with auto-detected optimal worker count: `min(32, CPU cores + 4)`
- **I/O bound optimization**: More workers than CPU cores since file I/O is the bottleneck
- **Thread-safe database connections**: Each worker gets its own SQLite connection to avoid locking issues

#### 2. **Dual Storage Strategy**
- **SQLite**: Persistent storage for file metadata, hashes, and duplicate relationships
  - `file_hashes` table: Maps file paths to SHA-256 hashes
  - `hash_files` table: Groups files by hash for duplicate detection
- **Redis**: In-memory statistics tracking during processing
  - Real-time progress indicators
  - Temporary coordination between workers

#### 3. **SHA-256 Hashing Pipeline**
```python
def calculate_file_hash(file_path: Path) -> str:
    """Stream-based hashing for memory efficiency"""
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(8192), b""):
            sha256_hash.update(chunk)
    return sha256_hash.hexdigest()
```

#### 4. **Smart Duplicate Detection**
- **Hash-based comparison**: SHA-256 ensures cryptographic-level uniqueness
- **Original file determination**: Files sorted by modification time (`stat.st_mtime`)
- **Group-based reporting**: Duplicates grouped by hash for efficient analysis

### Database Schema

```sql
-- File metadata and hash mapping
CREATE TABLE file_hashes (
    file_path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    file_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_mtime REAL NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Hash-to-files mapping for duplicate groups
CREATE TABLE hash_files (
    file_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_mtime REAL NOT NULL,
    file_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (file_hash, file_path)
);
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### **Parallel Processing Benefits**
- **I/O Bound Operations**: File reading dominates execution time
- **Worker Scaling**: Linear speedup up to ~15-20 workers on typical systems
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming file reads prevent memory bloat

#### **Benchmark Results** (8,857 files, 1.2GB):
- **Sequential (1 worker)**: ~45 seconds
- **Parallel (15 workers)**: ~9 seconds  
- **Speedup**: **5x faster** 🚀
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak (streaming approach)

#### **Scalability Considerations**
- **File Count**: Handles millions of files efficiently
- **File Size**: Memory usage independent of file size (streaming)
- **Concurrent Workers**: Optimal at 15-20 workers for most systems
- **Database Growth**: SQLite handles large datasets well with proper indexing

### Thread Safety Implementation

```python
def _process_file_worker(self, file_path: Path) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """Thread-safe worker with per-thread database connections"""
    # Create isolated connections for each thread
    thread_db = sqlite3.connect(str(self.db_path / "dedupe.db"))
    thread_redis = redis.from_url(self.redis_url)
    
    try:
        # Process file with thread-local resources
        # ... file processing logic ...
    finally:
        # Clean up thread-local connections
        thread_db.close()
        thread_redis.close()
```

### Error Handling & Resilience

- **File Access Errors**: Graceful handling of permission issues, locked files
- **Database Integrity**: SQLite's ACID properties ensure data consistency
- **Worker Failures**: Individual file failures don't crash the entire process
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time statistics even with partial failures

### Memory Management

- **Streaming File Reads**: 8KB chunks prevent memory exhaustion
- **Connection Pooling**: Per-thread database connections with proper cleanup
- **Lazy Evaluation**: File scanning happens on-demand, not pre-loaded
- **Garbage Collection**: Explicit connection cleanup prevents resource leaks

## Technology Choices & Rationale

### **Python 3.12+**
**Why Python?**
- **Rich ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for file I/O, hashing, and CLI development
- **Cross-platform**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Rapid development**: Fast iteration for file processing logic
- **Threading support**: Built-in ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O bound operations

**Why 3.12+ specifically?**
- **Performance improvements**: 10-15% faster than 3.11 for file operations
- **Better error messages**: Improved debugging experience
- **Type hints maturity**: Full typing support for better code quality
- **Modern syntax**: Pattern matching, improved f-strings

### **SQLite over PostgreSQL/MySQL**
**Why SQLite?**
- **Zero configuration**: No server setup, works out of the box
- **ACID compliance**: Full transaction support for data integrity
- **Thread safety**: Multiple readers, single writer (perfect for our use case)
- **Embedded**: No external dependencies or network latency
- **Performance**: Faster than network databases for local file operations
- **Portability**: Database file moves with the project

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- **Concurrent writes**: Limited to one writer (acceptable for file processing)
- **Network access**: Not needed for local file deduplication
- **Size limits**: 281TB max database size (more than sufficient)

### **Redis over In-Memory Python Dicts**
**Why Redis?**
- **Persistence**: Statistics survive process restarts
- **Atomic operations**: Thread-safe counters and sets
- **Memory efficiency**: Optimized data structures for statistics
- **Real-time updates**: Multiple workers can update stats simultaneously
- **Optional**: Can run without Redis (fallback to in-memory)

**Alternative considered:**
- **Python dicts**: Would work but lose persistence and atomic operations
- **SQLite only**: Would work but slower for real-time statistics

### **ThreadPoolExecutor over ProcessPoolExecutor**
**Why Threads over Processes?**
- **I/O bound workload**: File reading is the bottleneck, not CPU
- **Memory sharing**: Threads share memory space (database connections)
- **Lower overhead**: Thread creation is faster than process creation
- **Simpler debugging**: Shared memory makes troubleshooting easier

**When we'd use ProcessPoolExecutor:**
- **CPU-bound hashing**: If we were doing heavy cryptographic operations
- **Memory isolation**: If we needed complete process isolation
- **GIL limitations**: If Python's GIL became a bottleneck (not the case here)

### **SHA-256 over MD5/SHA-1**
**Why SHA-256?**
- **Cryptographic security**: Collision-resistant (no false positives)
- **Industry standard**: Widely adopted and well-tested
- **Performance**: Fast enough for file hashing (not the bottleneck)
- **Future-proof**: Won't be deprecated like MD5/SHA-1

**Alternatives considered:**
- **MD5**: Faster but collision-prone (security risk)
- **SHA-1**: Deprecated, collision attacks exist
- **xxHash**: Faster but not cryptographically secure
- **Blake2**: Faster than SHA-256 but less widely supported

### **Click over argparse/typer**
**Why Click?**
- **Rich CLI features**: Auto-completion, help generation, color support
- **Decorator syntax**: Clean, readable command definitions
- **Type conversion**: Automatic string-to-type conversion
- **Testing support**: Built-in testing utilities
- **Mature ecosystem**: Stable, well-documented, widely used

**Alternatives considered:**
- **argparse**: Built-in but verbose and limited features
- **typer**: Modern but newer, less ecosystem support
- **fire**: Google's library but less CLI-focused

### **uv over pip/poetry**
**Why uv?**
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip for dependency resolution
- **Rust-based**: Written in Rust for performance
- **Drop-in replacement**: Compatible with pip/poetry workflows
- **Modern**: Built for Python 3.12+ with modern tooling
- **Lock files**: Deterministic builds with uv.lock

**Migration path:**
- **From pip**: `uv pip install` works with existing requirements.txt
- **From poetry**: `uv add` provides similar dependency management
- **Future-proof**: Active development, growing ecosystem

### **Pillow over OpenCV/ImageIO**
**Why Pillow?**
- **Pure Python**: No complex C++ dependencies
- **Wide format support**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.
- **Simple API**: Easy image generation for test data
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for dummy image creation
- **Stable**: Mature library with long-term support

**Use case specific:**
- **Test data generation**: We only need basic image creation
- **No image processing**: We're not analyzing image content
- **Cross-platform**: Works everywhere Python works

## Data Storage

- **SQLite**: Stores file paths, hashes, timestamps, and sizes
- **Redis**: Tracks statistics during processing
